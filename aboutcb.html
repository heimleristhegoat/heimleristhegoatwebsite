            <h2>What is the Collegeboard?</h2> 
            <p>The Collegeboard is a nonprofit organization focused on student success. They are in charge of the well-known SAT and the Advanced Placement (AP) program for high school students.</p>
			<p>The main goal of the AP program is to earn college credit while in high school. The scale goes from 1 to 5, 3 being the passing (C letter grade), 4 being good (B letter grade), and a 5 being a perfect score (A- or A letter grade).</p>
			<p> Classes range from social studies, science, math, and english. Depending on what your student is good at, they may take none, one, or many. </p>
			<p> While this is good in theory, not all colleges accept the 3 (passing), 4, or even a 5 at all since they either have stingy requirements or they simply do not carry that equivalent program in college. Check the college your student is applying to before taking an AP class. </p>
